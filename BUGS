Last Update: 14/08/2003

- Sometimes wayV seems to just stop accepting inputs (?)

- Managed input window doesn't send key press events properly

- Lots of ones in the parser, both reading and writing but they shouldn't 
  affect version 0.2 unless people are creating their own gestures and 
  using %,"\ or ; in the wrong place in way's configuration file.
  NOTE: This will be fixed in version 0.3, the parser will be completely
  rewritten.

- Modifier keys can affect the emulated key press'
