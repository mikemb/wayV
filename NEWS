I'm (Mike) changing the development model of wayV. No longer am I going
to go for rare big releases, instead I'm going to adopt a policy of code
often, release often.

This 0.3 release is primarily the excellent work of Nick Rusnov and his
maintaince of wayV for Debian, including the various bug fixes and
functionality improvements!

Finished version 0.2 and released it. Whew :)

19/02/2001
==========
The project is now fully active again and will continue so for the
foreseeable future. Also migrated the website over to stressbunny.com

02/08/2000
==========
Release version 0.1 - the first official release. This has keyboard
modifiers, etc. Now there is a good framework which can be built
upon.

20/06/2000
==========
Launched the initial test version pre 0.1 - its numbered 0.0.9 and will
only be around for a few days. Its just to iron out the few issues.

Have a look at the ChangeLog for more up to date technical news.
