1. Upgrading from 0.2 to 0.3
2. Upgrading from 0.1 to 0.2


1. Section: Upgrading from 0.2 to 0.3
*************************************

There are no major changes when upgrading from version 0.2 to
version 0.3, the main thing is that you can now define the Launch
action (see wayv.conf) to use mouse button Mx where x refers to
a button on your mouse.


2. Section: Upgrading from 0.1 to 0.2
*************************************

Introduction
------------
This should be read by people who have used wayV version 0.1

It outlines the important changes made to the main configuration
file wayv.conf - from version 0.1 to version 0.2

When you're installing wayV 0.2 make SURE you backup your existing
wayv.conf file!


Upgrading from 0.1 to 0.2
-------------------------
At the moment the only method to upgrade the wayv.conf file from
version 0.1 to 0.2 is to either:

1. overwrite it completely therefore loosing all your settings
2. manually update the wayv.conf file to be 0.2 compliant

Remember backup your existing wayv.conf first!

Yes, there should be a shell script which does all this automatically -
please write it :)

- set Version to 0.2
- serious extensions to Pretty structure, you're best copying
  the from 0.2 into your 0.1 file and setting the sub-keys as required
- small change to Universe, has new sub-key called vectors which
  should be present
- completely new structure called Include, you're best copying it 
  from the 0.2 configuration file
- make sure the file DEFAULT.wkey is in the same place as wayv.conf
- every Gesture structure has a new sub-key called vector which should
  be added to every Gesture (it can be set to "vector = ;")
